Now can you have a look at the attached picture. This is how I'd like you to do the schedule of the availability for the service provider. If you have a look at it carefully, you'll see that it's got the, what do you call them, the pills, what do you call them. So the availability is highlighted. Now what you do is you probably, just do it hourly, that's all you need. Now also, whether or not you want it reoccurring or not, at the top there, at the top of each day, where you want it reoccurring is next week, so next Sunday. Now what I'd like you to also add, I know I've said all this before, but anyway, is a button on each day, turning the day off. So switching the day off, so you want the day off tomorrow, so tomorrow is Friday, you don't want to work, you turn the day off, but it doesn't turn the following Friday's off if you've got reoccurring switched on. Now if you have a look at these particular, look at the shape of these pills, those have just the very very edge corners, have the curved edges, almost square, just a little curve. So just stick to that sort of like format with everything. So that's still good when they go to mobile view. And you see at the top of that, you've got the week of March, whatever the date is, each day obviously has a date on it, there's always, the 7 days you have will always be the 7 days you're in. Might be you can skip ahead and alter next week's if you want, but it's not very up to you to do that. So there you go, please get that done, that means you've got to get rid and make these red in colour, just keep the theme the same throughout. I like this colour that we've got up, but just keep the same sort of colour that you've got the rest. And if you're able, can you put a theme changer in the settings in the back, something like that. I know this is a fairly basic UI, but it still looks OK, and I think it's a nice theming, it'll probably be OK. If you can make the colour that we've got on the screen now, a theme colour, that'd be good, I actually rather like that, it's quite cool, I actually like that colour, especially with the background, it's quite a cool colour. Yeah, so I'll move on, get this thing going. Yeah, so you've put a theme selector, that'd be terrific as well. Please, thank you.
