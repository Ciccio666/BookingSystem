I'll provide you the foundational requirements for the front-end implementation. The application will consist of several modern, responsive pages designed with a sleek, mobile-first approach. The core modules include:

1. **SMS Application**: 
   - Mobile-first, responsive layout.
   - Desktop: Conversation column on the left, chat view on the right.
   - Mobile: Single conversation view.
   - Features: Emoji support, file uploads, and other standard messaging functionalities.
   - Conversation column: Search functionality at the top, plus (+) button to initiate new conversations.

2. **AI Chat Page**:
   - Standard chat interface integrating with OpenAI.
   - No credentials required on the front-end; backend integration already handled.

3. **12-Persona AI Chat Page**:
   - Specialized interface for intensive AI training boot camp.
   - Supports multiple AI personas (up to 12), detailed interactions, and persona-specific functionalities.

4. **AI Settings Page**:
   - Comprehensive page to configure extensive AI-related settings.
   - Includes toggles for AI mode, training mode, and training control operations (ON, OFF, PAUSE, RESET, START_OVER).

5. **Bookings Module**:
   - Page to manage client bookings, services offered, and availability.
   - Supports defining weekly time slots, booking windows, service pricing, duration, deposits, and buffer times.
   - Integration-friendly, capable of incorporating existing full-featured booking systems if available to expedite development.

Each page will serve as an initial implementation, ready for future refinements. All backend integrations, including credentials, are already in place and managed separately.
